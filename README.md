# Still in Motion

Still in Motion is an artistic project that transforms the cinematic experience into a meditative display on a static e-paper screen. For this rendition, we feature the 2015 masterpiece Embrace of the Serpent.

The idea is straightforward yet deeply impactful: the entire film is presented frame by frame, with each frame displayed for 24 minutes. This creates a "faux frame rate" of 24 frames per hour, turning the traditionally fleeting nature of film into a slow and contemplative journey. At this pace, the 125-minute runtime of Embrace of the Serpent extends to an immersive experience lasting approximately 125 days.

This project invites viewers to engage with film in a new wayâ€”one that blurs the lines between motion and stillness, storytelling and reflection.
